# HDF-AI Tools and Information Center

This is a central hub for exchanging AI solutions HDF5.
It also hosts sample AI data / model files in HDF5.

## Data
* [Cat vs. Non-Cat](https://www.floydhub.com/deeplearningai/datasets/cat-vs-noncat/1/train_catvnoncat.h5)
* [Core ML Specification](https://apple.github.io/coremltools/coremlspecification/)

## Source Code
* [Deep Learning for Climiate Modeling Data](https://github.com/azrael417/ClimDeepLearn): specifically, [data_helpers.py](https://github.com/azrael417/ClimDeepLearn/blob/distributed/semanticsegm/utils/data_helpers.py)

## HDF5 AI Filter

  Filtering Bigdata with AI is a scalable solution.

  HDF5 AI filter can kick in to sanitize your data in scalable manner
  when you archive data in HDF5.
  It can save a lot of storage by storing only models, not real data.
